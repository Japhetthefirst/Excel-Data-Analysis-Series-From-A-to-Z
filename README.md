# Excel-Data-Analysis-Series-From-A-to-Z
Welcome to my Excel Data Analysis A–Z Series — a personal learning and project journey through 26 different dataset genres, each representing a letter of the alphabet (A–Z).

This series showcases my growing skills in data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insights generation using Microsoft Excel, Power Query, and Power Pivot.
Each letter stands for a unique dataset category — from Automobiles (A) to Zoology (Z) — analyzed end-to-end using only Excel tools.
